                  <h3>Lorem, ipsum dolor.</h3>
                  <p>I am a graduate in Psychology and English Literature, driven by a deep curiosity to understand human behavior and the underlying reasons behind people's actions. This curiosity has shaped my belief that individuals are profoundly influenced by their environment and early childhood experiences. I firmly believe that schools play a pivotal role in shaping a person’s character, building confidence, and unlocking their potential.
                      Coming from an underprivileged background, I am deeply grateful for the guidance of Teach For India fellows, who showed me that learning can be enjoyable and that education is a powerful tool to transform dreams into reality. This transformative experience not only broadened my perspective but also inspired me to pursue the Teach For India fellowship, as I want to play a pivotal role in providing quality education and unlocking opportunities for children.</p>
